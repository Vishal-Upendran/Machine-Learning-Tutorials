# Machine-Learning-Tutorials


This repository is a collection of different notebooks, presentations and tutorials mainly pertaining to machine and deep learning. This repo will grow over time, as I keep sharing what I know and keep learning new aspects of ML.

## 2022-11-28: Second Aditya-L1 science support cell workshop @ MAHE, Udupi

I gave a talk introducing ML/DL and performed a hands-on exercise on the final day of this workshop. The attendees were exposed to the different types of ML problems, and were shown examples of application of ML/DL in Heliophysics. The lecture slides are made availabe [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQYRb6bEMgvXlZQi1n5cJEYT2Rkfya5IkyXgKXn7trMaiuE_61lFyvbIS2Uf486BqQ-EZmm8tJuyTdP/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000) The hands-on session showcased the application of an SVM and DNN to classifying SHARP features of Active Regions into flaring or non-flaring. This was done in a [Colab notebook](https://github.com/Vishal-Upendran/Machine-Learning-Tutorials/blob/main/ML_tutorial_AdityaL1_2022_11_25.ipynb), also uploaded with this repository.
